# Claymorphism UI Design Examples

This document contains inspirational examples of Claymorphism in UI design. Claymorphism is characterized by soft, puffy, clay-like elements with rounded corners and soft shadows that give interfaces a tactile, playful appearance.

## Introduction to Claymorphism

Claymorphism is a design trend that emerged around 2021 as a playful alternative to Neumorphism. It features soft, rounded shapes resembling clay or plasticine, with multiple soft shadows to create a 3D, puffy appearance. The style uses bright, friendly colors and emphasizes a tactile, moldable feel.

## UI Examples from Dribbble

Below are examples of Claymorphism in UI design, showcasing how this style can be applied to different interface elements and components.

## Characteristics of Claymorphism in These Examples

Looking at these examples, we can identify several consistent characteristics of Claymorphism:

1. **Extremely rounded corners** - Almost all elements have generous border-radius values
2. **Soft, multi-layered shadows** - Creating the illusion of depth and softness
3. **Bright, playful colors** - Often with pastel accents
4. **Chunky, puffy elements** - With generous padding and space
5. **Tactile appearance** - Elements that look like they can be pressed or molded
6. **Playful illustrations** - Often incorporating blob-like shapes and characters
7. **Simplified iconography** - Clean, rounded icons that match the overall aesthetic
