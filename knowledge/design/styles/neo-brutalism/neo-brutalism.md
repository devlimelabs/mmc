Introduction

This guide provides a detailed overview of the Neo-Brutalism design style, aimed at assisting AI models in interpreting and implementing this style effectively in web and app design. By understanding the core principles and elements of Neo-Brutalism, AI can generate creative and authentic designs that adhere to this trend.

Understanding Neo-Brutalism

What is Neo-Brutalism?

Neo-Brutalism is a design trend that emphasizes raw, unrefined elements, showcasing the basic structure of a website or app. It is characterized by bold colors, stark typography, and simple geometric shapes. This style is a modern take on the mid-20th-century Brutalist architecture movement, which favored functionality over aesthetics.

Differences Among Neo-Brutalism, Brutalism, and Minimalism

	•	Brutalism: Originated from the French term béton brut (raw concrete). In design, it reflects a raw, unpolished aesthetic with minimal decoration.
	•	Neo-Brutalism: Builds upon Brutalism by incorporating more vibrant colors and unique elements while maintaining the raw aesthetic.
	•	Minimalism: Focuses on simplicity and functionality, using minimal elements to create a clean and uncluttered design.

Core Elements of Neo-Brutalism Design

Color Palette

	•	Black: Use pure black #000000 confidently for strokes, text, and shadows.
	•	Background Colors: Utilize vibrant, vintage, or muted colors for backgrounds. Avoid gradients; stick to solid colors.
	•	Vibrant Colors: High-saturation hues like electric blue #0000FF, neon green #39FF14, or bright red #FF0000.
	•	Vintage and Muted Colors: Colors with reduced saturation, such as dusty pink #D8A7B1 or olive green #808000.

Components and Elements

	•	Shapes: Incorporate basic geometric shapes like rectangles, circles, stars, and polygons with bold black strokes.
	•	Strokes and Shadows:
	•	Strokes: Use solid black lines (1-3px) around components.
	•	Shadows: Apply drop shadows with both X and Y offsets, no blur, and black color at 100% opacity. Example: box-shadow: 10px 10px 0px 0px #000000;.
	•	Decorative Elements: Include moving banners, images with backgrounds and strokes, and simplistic illustrations reminiscent of early web graphics or MS Paint drawings.

Examples:

Typography

	•	Font Choice: Prefer bold, sans-serif fonts with strong character.
	•	Examples:
	•	Lexend Mega
	•	Public Sans
	•	Archivo Black
	•	Bebas Neue
	•	Text Styling:
	•	Headings: Use large font sizes (e.g., 48px and above).
	•	Line Height and Letter Spacing: Experiment with tight letter spacing and varying line heights to create visual impact.
	•	Typography as Decoration: Use text not just for content but as a graphical element.

Step-by-Step Design Process

Example: Redesigning an Instagram Profile Page

1. Add Strokes and Shadows

	•	Apply black strokes around images and buttons.
	•	Use bold shadows to create a layered effect.

.profile-picture {
  border: 2px solid #000000;
  box-shadow: 10px 10px 0px 0px #000000;
}

2. Change Colors

	•	Replace the white background with a vibrant color (e.g., pastel blue #A0E7E5).
	•	Alter button colors to contrasting hues.

3. Modify Typography

	•	Update fonts to a bold sans-serif typeface like Archivo Black.
	•	Increase the size of headings and reduce letter spacing.

h1 {
  font-family: 'Archivo Black', sans-serif;
  font-size: 64px;
  letter-spacing: -1px;
}

Final Result:

Considerations for Using Neo-Brutalism

When to Use

	•	Creative Portfolios: For designers, artists, or photographers showcasing their work.
	•	Experimental Projects: Startups or tech companies aiming for an avant-garde appearance.
	•	Specific Websites: Sites that benefit from standing out through unique design.

When Not to Use

	•	Data-Heavy Applications: Complex software with extensive data may become cluttered.
	•	Broad Audience Apps: Applications targeting a wide demographic may require a more neutral design.
	•	Accessibility Concerns: The harsh contrasts and bold elements may not be suitable for users with visual impairments.
