# Design Style Library

This library curates visual directions for product teams working inside MMC. Each subfolder describes one aesthetic with:
- a narrative overview for briefing agents or collaborators,
- quick-reference checklists (`*-cheatsheet.md`) that summarize colors, typography, and key motifs,
- inspiration links and prompts (`*-images.md`) for sourcing visuals or texture packs.

Start with `design-styles-reference.md` for a catalog view, then dive into individual folders when you need deeper context. During agent sessions, reference files explicitly (e.g., `knowledge/design/styles/neo-brutalism/neo-brutalism.md`) so assistants can ingest only the relevant aesthetic.
