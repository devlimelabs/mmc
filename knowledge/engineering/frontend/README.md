# Frontend Architecture Notes

Angular reference material lives here until broader engineering standards are defined. Current artifacts:
- `state-architecture.data-flow.md` — outlines the reactive data stream for complex apps.
- `angular-state-pattern.mermaid` — diagram source describing component → service → store interactions.

When adding new frameworks, create sibling folders (e.g., `react/`, `svelte/`) and keep diagrams in plain text so agents can inline them during context assembly.
